title: A Simple Self-hosted Static Comment System for Jekyll
tags: ["Static Comment System", "Jekyll"]
---

I've had my eyes on a comment system for my website for some time now. The only thing holding me back is the relative lack of a simple static system suitable for a small blog. One of my big concerns about the commenting systems that exist today is the lack of anonymity and the way that they harvest user data. Their business model is based on the false premise that users want targeted advertisements as an opt-out. Take Disqus for example. Disqus integration in a website ruins the whole web experience by loading a ton of javascript and advertisments. Their worst feature is the recommended section just above the comments. Disqus apparently has a deal with Taboola and Outbrains, two Israeli companies, to quitely insert recommended bullshit into other peoples websites. The worst of paid trash around the web delivered at your door step. Nothing but click baits and the excreta of degenerated minds. 

One thing I've learned about the web is that if you want to get something done go ahead and do it yourself. So I've decided to make my own comment system that would be open source and self hosted.
