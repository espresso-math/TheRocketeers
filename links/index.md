#### <i class="fa fa-university"></i> Knowledge

* Wolfram [Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/). Eric Weisstein's online encyclopedia of mathematics.
* Smithsonian [Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/). Covers science, art and culture.
* Plus [Magazine](https://plus.maths.org/content/). A good magazine for popular mathematics.
* For the inventor in you. But do you know how to [Charlieplex](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Charlieplexing)?
* An Ancient World [Encyclopedia](http://www.ancient.eu/) that is thoroughly modern.
* From the horse's mouth. [Terrence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together/) speakth.
* GÃ¶del's incompleteness [theorem](https://plus.maths.org/content/goumldel-and-limits-logic).
* Feynman's famed [lectures](http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/). Now shiny and on the web. (For free!)
* Ever heard of the Foreign Service Institute? You can access their language [archive](http://fsi-language-courses.org) for free.
* Perhaps the most entertaining and knowledgeable [article](http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/vis/02-analogy) I've read on the web in a long while.
* Pronounce German the [right way](http://joycep.myweb.port.ac.uk/pronounce/).
* Ever wonder how Google manages to correct every [BS blunder](http://www.norvig.com/spell-correct.html) we type into it and still look magnanimous doing it?
* Take a peep under the [Iron Curtain](http://mentallandscape.com/V_LaunchVehicles.htm). The Soviet union did have a lot of firsts in space.

#### <i class="fa fa-paw"></i> For the soul

* Loves a free bird, it needs to fly... ([Habanera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px36njyCnVM))
* Sing along in German to these [songs](http://www.fluentu.com/german/blog/learn-german-with-songs-music/).

#### Book Recommendation

* Try reading [these](http://olympiads.win.tue.nl/imo/books.html) when you're feeling on top of the world.
* Love Fantasy? This is the most [exhaustive review](http://bestfantasybooks.com/top25-fantasy-books.php) I've seen yet.

#### <i class="fa fa-unlock"></i> Free Stuff

* Amazing free [stock images](https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/free-stock-photos/). Because every web designer knows how hard it is to find good free stock images.
* How could you not use these [free tools](http://blog.ghost.org/distributed-team-tools/)?
* This is [a tool](http://www.textise.net/) I use when I don't have enough data left for browsing.
* My awesome domain name is registered for free at [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org). While there don't forget to say hi to my man, Joshua Anderson.

#### <i class="fa fa-wheelchair"></i> Fallacies of the Web

* Business Insider is a well respected organization. How they'd let such an article slip through is beyond me. Titled "[If you can solve these Math problems, you are smart as the worlds smartest teenagers](http://www.businessinsider.com/if-you-can-solve-these-math-problems-you-are-as-smart-as-the-worlds-smartest-teenagers-2013-5?op=1)", this article is a one stop exercise in utter nonsense. Those Math problems aren't half as tough as they seem to think and solving tough problems doesn't make you the worlds smartest teenager. I could introduce you to a whole realm full of teenagers who routinely solve even more difficult problems than those. 
* You need to get your ideas checked [here](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html) at least once in your lifetime.
